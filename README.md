# 🛣️ Safety Analysis using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
**Safety Analysis** is a machine learning-based system designed to evaluate the safety of roads based on street images.  
This project is trained on images collected throughout the **IIT Bhubaneswar campus**, captured under diverse environmental and lighting conditions.

The system analyzes various visual and contextual features from street images — such as **human activity**, **time of day**, **presence of vehicles**, **illumination**, and **surrounding infrastructure** — to classify areas into one of three safety categories:
- 🟢 **Safe**
- 🟡 **Risky**
- 🔴 **Dangerous**

---

## 🧠 Approach

### 1. **Data Collection**
Street images were captured across multiple campus locations at different times of the day and under varying weather conditions to ensure diversity.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**
We detected and manually labeled features such as:
- Human activities  
- Vehicles  
- Lighting conditions  
- Nearby monuments/infrastructure  
- Time of day  

These were annotated in a CSV file along with the safety class label.

### 3. **Image Preprocessing**
To obtain compact and meaningful image representations, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Image compression and resizing  
- Multiple convolutional passes using **manual kernels** (Sobel, Laplacian, DoG, etc.)  
- Pooling operations for dimensionality reduction  
- Flattening to a **1D feature vector**

### 4. **Feature Fusion**
The **image-derived vector** was concatenated with the **CSV-based contextual features** to form the complete input dataset (**X**).  
This combined representation captures both **visual** and **semantic** safety cues.

### 5. **Model Training**
Multiple machine learning models were trained and compared to identify the most effective classifier for road safety prediction.  
Typical models explored include:
- Logistic Regression
- QDA
- Naive Bayes
- KNN Classifier
- Decison Trees 
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Gradient Boosting  

The final output predicts whether a given street environment is **Safe**, **Risky**, or **Dangerous**.

## 🚀 Future Work
This system will be **scaled up** to handle large-scale datasets and generalized to analyze streets across **any city or region**.  
Further improvements will include:
- Deep feature extraction using CNNs  
- Integration with GPS and temporal data  
- Real-time safety analysis via mobile or drone-based applications
